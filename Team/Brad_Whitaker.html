<p>Brad’s Lean Journey began 17 years ago after completing an Industrial Engineering Degree.  Brad has built on his capability and skills of Lean Six-Sigma and Total Quality Management through strategic application in various industries from Large Scale Automotive to Small/Medium Enterprises.  Brad’s experience has spanned from implementing Lean Principles (Toyota, GM Holden, Lumascape) to leading Oceania Region Continuous Improvement Programs (Toyota).  Brad has held supervision and management positions (Toyota) with the realisation that the key to successful implementation of Lean Six-Sigma and Continuous Improvement is through the development of people.</p>

<p>More recently, Brad has joined the Vative team to support Australian Businesses in a wide range of industries including manufacturing, construction, finance, healthcare, warehousing and logistics to support goals for continuous improvement.  This support extends from driving companies to become self-sufficient in continuous improvement by the implementation of Lean principles through Certified Training and Project programs to specific projects in Business Optimisation and Process Improvement.  These activities involve all levels within business from shop-floor members up to Senior Management.  Positive returns on investment are regularly realised through projects that pursue Business Optimisation and the Reduction of Waste.  These returns include large cost reductions, unlocking capital for business growth, accelerated development of skill and capabilities of employees and improved morale.  Brad is passionate about being involved in the transformation of businesses that implement Lean Six-Sigma and Continuous Improvement.</p>
