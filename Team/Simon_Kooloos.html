<p>A Principal Business Excellence Advisor with fifteen years professional experience that spans manufacturing, transport and mining industries. His approach to work revolves around the customers priorities and he is a follower of the principle that “the right process will produce the right results”. This is derived from his solid background in 'Lean' and 'Six Sigma’. His continuous improvement career was founded during the eight years he worked at Ford Motor Company and has continued across different engineering-related industries in both a strategic and tactical capacity. This has reinforced his solid understanding that effective project delivery requires the critical balance of a sound practical solution with good change management. </p><p>In 2010 he added Diploma of Management to his Metallurgical Engineering, Six Sigma qualifications and Lean training. His varied technical leadership experience in multiple industries has developed Simon’s capability to a point where he is looking for new and varied business improvement challenges.
