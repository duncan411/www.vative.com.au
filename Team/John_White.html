<p>John has over 30 years experience in General Management and Sales Team Leadership roles, with a sound record of delivering profitable growth in enterprise focussed strategic sales, where the emphasis is on adding real bottom line value to the Customers business.</p>
<p>John has successfully lead and developed teams of up to 70 people in the printing, supply chain management and direct mail industries before finding his home in the Learning and Development sector.  After 3 years focussed on leadership programs John discovered his skills and values more closely aligned with the ethics, application and productivity outcomes delivered by Vative and their Lean Six-Sigma expertise.</p>  
<p>Johnâ€™s formal training qualifications include a current Certificate IV in Training and Assessment (TAE 40110) as well as extensive management and leadership courses, including a graduation from a Brannan Cross Strategic Account Planning program.  His experience includes two visits to US and Canadian operations as part of developing Business Plans for the investment and introduction of new technologies into the Australasian marketplace.</p>
<p>All this has provided John with a deep understanding of the business needs of a wide variety of industries and he understands how to use this knowledge to assist customers to identify the key areas of need and opportunity that a Vative Lean Six-Sigma program can optimise for them.
