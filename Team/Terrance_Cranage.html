<p>Terrance has over 7 yearsâ€™ experience in the Vocational Educational Training (VET) sector. Commencing with a start-up RTO (from the conception as a business), to $3.6m over 3 years through cold calling; more effective client management and a passion to improve and assist clients to get the very best outcomes. Coming into contact with Vative in there commencement year and seeing the real value add, Terrance directed his clients to lean Six-Sigma </p>
<p>Terrance has successfully lead and developed a team of 4 people in Victoria and trained a representatives in QLD in the Pharmacy and Health food Industry, Marketing and distributing over 2000 different, Over The Counter Products . Due to negative elements in that industry, Terrance then moved into the VET sector firstly for 7 years with an RTO then a year working for the State Government as a Skills For Growth Consultant. It was in this year that Terrance was able to assess the industry from a non-biased point of view and discovered his skills and values more closely aligned with the ethics, application and productivity outcomes delivered by Vative and their Lean Six-Sigma expertise.   </p>
<p>Terrance has formal training qualifications include a current Certificate IV in Training and Assessment (TAE 40110) with extensive knowledge in the VET sector/Education Industry.
Time in the VET Sector and long involvement with Vative and Lean Six-Sigma has given Terrance a deep understanding of the business needs in a wide variety of industries and he understands how and where Lean Six-Sigma can be applied to assist customers to identify the key areas of need and opportunity that a Vative Lean Six-Sigma program can provide for them.</p>
